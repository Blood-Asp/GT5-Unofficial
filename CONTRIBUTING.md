# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via our public Discord channel if possible. 
Be sure to consult the correct channel and dev, use #gregtech5 for GT5u and gregtech5-12 for GT 5.10/5.12 development. 

Please note we have a level of quality to maintain, please follow the guidelines in all your interactions within the project.

## Issue Creation Process

1. Try and see if the issue already has a pre-existing issue open. 
2. Provide the version of GT you are using and the version of IC2. Providing a full modlist helps. 
3. Try to explain the issue in details and include any aditional info if possible. Screenshots, Video or a way to reproduce the issue.
* Failing to provide all of the above details can result in an issue being closed without action. 

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any new build dependencies are noted within the PR details and why it's a valid requirement. 
2. Try ensure that the build works successfully and attempt to test it yourself thoroughly.  
3. Please open a new PR for each issue you wish to resolve instead of fixing ten bugs in one go. This makes review easier, thank you. 
4. You will have the Pull Request merged in once you have the sign-off of tone other developer & @Blood-Asp, also whenever @Blood-Asp finds time. 

## Standard of Quality

### Our Goal

In the interest of fostering an open project environment, we as
contributors and maintainers try to make participation in our project and
our community a hassle-free experience wherever possible..

### Our Standards

Practices that contribute to creating a positive environment
include:

* Follow the codestyle used through most of the project
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints on the PR
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Try to document your code as you go for future readability.

Practies we'd like to avoid include:

* Leaving large code comment segments commented out without any comments.
* Making large changes to pre-existing content without large community consultation beforehand. (Provided that the code changed won't continue to be backcompatible for addons.)

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
